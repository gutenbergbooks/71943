<p>Although many elementary works on Astronomy are already before the public, yet it is
believed there is none in which the various magnitudes, surfaces, and distances of the heavenly
bodies, are presented to the eye of the learner by actual comparisons;—the only way, perhaps,
in which young pupils can be expected to form a correct idea of them. This the author has
attempted in the following pages. The comparative diameters, surfaces and distances of the
different planets, are all drawn, in the plates, according to a fixed scale of geographical miles; the
surfaces of the planets are actually reduced to square measure, and drawn in proportion to each
other and the sun; so that the youngest pupil, by a mere glance of the eye, is enabled to form a
correct idea of their respective magnitudes. A similar plan has been pursued, in regard to the
division of the Earth into Zones, and with respect to the extent of the five great Continents of our
Globe. The Appendix contains an exposition of the population of America, Europe, Asia, Africa,
and Australia, accompanied by a plate for the illustration of the comparative settlements on those
Continents.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="LESSON_I">LESSON I.</h2>

<p class="center no-indent fs90">THE EARTH IN ITS RELATION TO THE SUN, MOON AND STARS.</p>


<p>§ 1. The Earth on which we live, and on which plants, trees and animals
successively live and die, is only a small part of the world; it is but one of the
smallest bodies in the Universe. To the world belong yet the <em>Sun</em> from which
we receive warmth and light, the <em>Moon</em>, and an innumerable class of bodies,
which, at night, appear to us as so many points of light. These are called <em>Stars</em>.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The reason why the Stars appear to us so small, is because they are so far from us; and things
appear smaller in proportion as they are farther removed from us. This you will have noticed,
when looking from a high steeple on the people below, or on a vessel far out in the harbour, or
on a chain of mountains at a great distance.</p>
</div>

<p>§ 2. Most all Stars appear to us, every night in the same position; they seem
actually to be <em>fixed</em> in the heavens; and for this reason they are called <em>fixed Stars</em>.
There are however Ten others, of which it has been ascertained <em>that they move
regularly round the Sun in large circles</em>. These are called <em>Planets</em> or <em>wandering
Stars</em>.—The fixed Stars are supposed to be similar to the Sun, in as much as they
are bodies which have their own light. The Planets, on the contrary, are of
themselves dark bodies, and receive, like our Earth, light and warmth from the
Sun. We see them only in consequence of the solar light which they <em>reflect</em>
from their surfaces, and this is the reason why they appear to us as bright as the
other Stars.</p>

<p>§ 3. The discoveries of Philosophers have proved beyond a doubt, <em>that our
Earth itself is one of those Planets</em>, which move round the Sun in stupendous<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</span>
large circles, whose grandeur is hardly conceived by the most powerful imagination.
<em>Our Earth, therefore, is, itself, a Wandering Star</em>, and the line in which
it moves round the Sun is called its <em>Way</em> or <em>Orbit</em>.</p>

<p>§ 4. The Planets, together with our Earth keep each a certain fixed distance
from the Sun. On this account they do not disturb each other in their orbits.
But they vary from each other in magnitude; although all of them (consequently
also our Earth) have a <em>round</em> shape, similar to a ball.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>In former times men believed that the Earth was flat, or a circular plate on all sides surrounded
by water. But this is not true. For it has been proved by a great many observations and actual
measurements, that the Earth has a spherical (ball-like) form. Moreover there are navigators
who have actually <em>sailed round the world</em>, and who have noticed the fact that at sea, the tops of
distant objects are seen sooner than the rest; which again proves the spherical form of our
Earth. For an illustration you may look at the adjoining plate Plate No. <a href="#i_007">I</a>.</p>

<p>The man who is represented as standing on a portion of our Earth, will at first only see the
topmast of a vessel at sea; when she comes nearer his eye will discover a much greater portion
of her; but when in the third position every part of the vessel will be visible.</p>
</div>

<p>§ 5. Some of the Planets are, in their motion round the Sun, <em>accompanied by
other dark bodies</em>, which, like the Planets themselves, receive light and heat from
the Sun. These are called <em>Satellites</em> or <em>Moons</em>. Such a Satellite is the <em>Moon
which accompanies our Earth</em>; and there are Planets (as we shall see hereafter)
which have Four and Six, and One that has even Seven Moons.</p>

<p>§ 6. Besides the Planets and Moons there is yet another class of bodies,
moving round the Sun in exceedingly long ovals. They are but seldom visible,
and are distinguished from other heavenly bodies by a tail which is often three, four,
and more times larger than the body itself. These are called <em>Comets</em>; but their
number has not, as yet, been precisely ascertained.</p>

<p>§ 7. The Planets, Moons and Comets, together with the Sun around which
they move, form what is called our <em>Solar System</em>. But what will you say, if you
are told that each fixed Star in the firmament is a Sun which, like our’s, has its
Planets and satellites and Comets; in short, that each fixed Star is the centre of
a solar system, a thousand and more times larger than our own!! But how infinitely
great must God’s Creation appear to us, when we reflect that all these
globes, as well as our own, may be inhabited by reasonable beings!!!</p>

<p class="center no-indent">RECAPITULATION OF LESSON I.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>[If the pupil has learned and understood this lesson, it may perhaps be not unreasonable to suppose
he will like to know something more about the Planets and the Moons in our system. But
the teacher ought not to allow him to enter upon the second lesson, before he has recapitulated
the first.]</p>
</div>

<p class="center no-indent">QUESTIONS.</p>

<p>[§ 1.] Does the Earth, or the globe on which we live, comprise the whole world
which God has created? Is our Earth any considerable portion of the Universe?
What other bodies belong to it? Why do the Stars appear to us so small?</p>

<p>[§ 2.] Do all the Stars which we see remain in the same position? What are
those called which remain <em>fixed</em>? What, those, which are moving regularly
round the Sun? What are the fixed Stars supposed to be? Have the Planets any
light of their own? From what body do the Planets receive their light?</p>

<p>[§ 3.] What important discoveries have Philosophers made respecting the nature
of our Earth?</p>

<p>What is the line in which our Earth moves round the Sun, called?</p>

<p>[§ 4.] Why do the orbits of the different Planets not disturb each other? Are
all Planets of the same magnitude? What is their shape? What is the shape of
our Earth? What reason have you to believe, that the Earth is round? Explain
Plate <a href="#i_007">I</a>?</p>

<p>[§ 5.] By what are some Planets in their motion round the Sun accompanied?
What are the bodies which accompany them called? What body accompanies
our Earth in its motion round the Sun? Are there Planets which have more than
One Moon?</p>

<p>[§ 6.] What other class of bodies is there, besides the Planets and the Moons?
Are these bodies always visible? By what are these bodies distinguished? What
are they called?</p>

<p>[§ 7.] What do the Planets, Moons and Comets, together with the Sun, round
which they move, form? What is each fixed Star supposed to be?</p>

<p class="center no-indent fs90">OF THE PLANETS AND THEIR RELATIVE POSITION WITH REGARD TO THE SUN AND EACH
OTHER.</p>

<p>§ 8. The Planets of which we have spoken in the First Lesson are Eleven in
number, of which each has received a proper name. They are in the order in
which they are placed from the Sun, the following:</p>


<table class="autotable" style="width: 50%">
<tr>
<td class="tdl">Mercury.</td>
<td class="tdl">Juno.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="tdl">Venus.</td>
<td class="tdl">Ceres.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="tdl">The Earth.</td>
<td class="tdl">Pallas.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="tdl">Mars.</td>
<td class="tdl">Jupiter.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="tdl">Vesta.</td>
<td class="tdl">Saturn.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="tdc" colspan="2">Herschel.</td>
</tr>
</table>


<p>The adjoining diagram, on Plate No. <a href="#i_012">II</a>, may serve for an illustration. You
will see from it, that the Earth is the third Planet from the Sun. Mercury and
Venus come before it; the most remote from the Sun is <em>Herschel</em>, so called from
the astronomer’s name, who has but lately discovered it.</p>

<p>§ 9. The Earth is constantly attended by One Satellite (Lesson I, § 5); Jupiter
by Four (see the diagram), Saturn by Six, and Herschel by Seven. Saturn
is, besides, constantly surrounded by a broad luminous ring, which distinguishes
it from all other Planets, and of which we shall speak hereafter.</p>

<p>§ 10. With regard to the magnitude of the different Planets it has been observed
that although some of them are much larger than Our Earth; yet in Comparison
to the Sun they are but small bodies, as you may see from the figures on
plate No. <a href="#i_013">III</a>, in which the different Planets are drawn in proportion to the Sun:
you will perceive from it;</p>

<p>1. That the Sun is a great many times<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> larger than either of the Planets.</p>
<br>

<em>N<sup>o</sup>. III.</em>.<br>
</p>
</figcaption>
</figure>
<br>

<p>2. That the Sun is much larger than all the Planets (our Earth included)
taken together.</p>

<p>3. That Jupiter is the greatest Planet in our solar system.</p>

<p>4. That Saturn is the second Planet with regard to magnitude.</p>

<p>5. That Herschel ranks third.</p>

<p>6. That the Earth ranks fourth; but that</p>

<p>7. Each of the other Planets and the Moon are smaller than the Earth.</p>

<p>8. That either of the Planets Ceres, Vesta, Juno, Pallas is smaller than the
Moon.</p>

<p>§ 11. If you cut a ball or a sphere in halves, and through the centre of one of
the flat surfaces, draw a straight line across the whole surface, then this line is
called the <em>Diameter</em> of the ball or sphere.—Now as the Sun and the Planets are
nothing else but large balls or spheres (Lesson I, § 4), we may also speak of
their Diameters.—Thus we say, “the Diameter of the Sun is so many times
larger than that of the Earth; the Diameter of Jupiter is so many times larger
than that of Venus,” etc.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>You will now easily understand what the straight line means, which, in plate No. <a href="#i_013">III</a> is
drawn through the centre of the circle, which represents the Sun; also the straight lines
which are drawn through the circles which represent the Planets.—You will also perceive
from the first figure on plate No. <a href="#i_013">III</a>, that the Sun’s Diameter is larger than the Diameters of
all the Planets taken together.</p>
</div>

<p>§ 12. Plate No. <a href="#i_016">IV</a> represents the <em>surfaces</em> of the Planets, compared to that
of the Sun.—For you must know that it is possible to <em>measure</em> the surface of
a sphere; which is done by supposing it to be spread out, and then seeing how
many square inches, feet or yards it contains. This we have supposed to be done
with the surfaces of the Sun and Planets, and accordingly, have drawn their
square measurements, in Plate No. <a href="#i_016">IV</a>. in proportion to each other.</p>

<p>You will see from this Plate:</p>

<p>1. That the square-Contents of the Sun’s surface is greater than that of the
surfaces of all the Planets taken together.</p>

<p>2. That the square-Contents of the Earth’s surface is nearly as large as that
of the surfaces of Mercury and Venus taken together.</p>
<br>

<p class="right">
<em>N<sup>o</sup>. IV.</em><br>
</p>
</figcaption>
</figure>
<br>

<p>3. That the square-Contents of the surfaces of Vesta, Ceres, Juno and Pallas,
taken together, is not yet sufficient to cover the surface of our Earth.</p>

<p>4. That the square-Contents of Jupiter’s surface is larger than that of the surface
of any other Planet.</p>

<p>5. That the square-Contents of Jupiter’s surface is greater than that of the
surfaces of all other Planets taken together.</p>

<p>6. That Saturn’s surface is the next largest.</p>

<p>7. That Herschel’s is still larger than those of our Earth, Venus and Mercury
taken together.</p>

<p>8. That the square-Contents of the Moon is nearly as large as that of the surfaces
of Ceres, Vesta and Juno, taken together; and that it is larger than that of
Pallas’ surface taken alone.</p>

<p>In order that you may be better able to compare, you will find on Plate No. <a href="#i_020">V</a></p>

<p>1. The surfaces of the different Planets, all drawn upon the Sun’s surface;
from which you may see, how much larger the Sun’s surface is than the surfaces
of all the Planets and the Moon taken together.</p>

<p>2. The surface of the Earth compared to that of Mercury and Venus.</p>

<p>3. The Earth’s surface compared to that of the Four Asteroids Pallas, Ceres,
Juno and Vesta.</p>

<p>4. Jupiter’s surface compared to those of all the other Planets.</p>

<p>5. The square-Contents of the Moon compared to the surfaces of Vesta, Juno
and Ceres.</p>

<p>6. Herschel’s square-Contents compared to that of our Earth, Venus and Mercury
taken together.</p>

<p>§ 13. The Four Planets, Ceres, Vesta, Juno, and Pallas, are so small in proportion
to the other Planets, and are so near each other (they are almost at the same
distance from the Sun—see Plate <a href="#i_012">II</a>) that many distinguished philosophers are
of opinion, they are but the fragments of One large Planet, which, from some
cause or other, has <em>burst</em>.—But this is no subject for us now to inquire into;—we
will therefore proceed to describe in the next lesson, the motion of the different
Planets round the Sun.</p>

<p class="center no-indent">RECAPITULATION OF LESSON II.</p>

<p class="center no-indent">QUESTIONS.</p>

<p>[§ 8.] What are the names of the Eleven Planets <em>in the order in which they are
placed from the Sun</em>? How many Planets are there between the Earth and the
Sun? How many Planets come after our Earth? In what order then, is our
Earth placed among the Planets? (Is it the first, second, etc. from the Sun)?</p>

<p>[§ 9.] How many satellites accompany our Earth? What is it called? How
many satellites or Moons has Jupiter? How many has Saturn? How many has
Herschel? By what is Saturn particularly distinguished from all other Planets?</p>

<p>[§ 10.] Are all Planets of the same magnitude as our Earth? Are the Planets
in comparison to the Sun large or small bodies?—Is the Sun much larger than
any of the Planets? Is the Sun larger or smaller than all the Planets, including
our Earth, taken together? Which is the greatest of all Planets? Which Planet
ranks, in magnitude, next to Jupiter? Which of the Planets ranks third in
magnitude? Which, Fourth? What Planets are smaller than our Earth? What
Planets are smaller than the Moon?</p>

<p>[§ 11.] What do you call the <em>Diameter</em> of a ball or sphere? Is the Diameter of
the Sun larger or smaller than the Diameters of all the Planets taken together?</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The teacher may yet ask a number of questions respecting the Diameters of the Planets,
which the pupil will be able to answer by looking on Plate <a href="#i_013">III</a>. He may, for instance, ask
whether the Diameter of the Earth is larger or smaller than that of Venus? Whether the
Diameter of Jupiter or Saturn is the largest, etc.? This will oblige the pupil to <em>compare</em> the
different magnitudes of the Planets and their Diameters.</p>
</div>

<p>[§ 12.] What proportion does the square-Contents of the Sun’s surface bear to
that of the surfaces of all the Planets? What two Planets have together a surface
nearly as large as that of our Earth? Are the surfaces of Ceres, Vesta, Juno and
Pallas taken together sufficient or not, to cover the surface of our Earth? What
Planets, therefore, could be covered with the Earth’s surface? Which Planet has
the largest surface? What do you observe with regard to the square-Contents of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span>
Jupiter’s surface? and that of the surfaces of all other Planets, taken together?
What Planet’s surface comes next in magnitude to Jupiter’s? What Planet’s surface
is larger than that of our Earth, Venus and Mercury taken together? What

<p class="center no-indent fs90">EXPLAINING THE MOTION OF THE PLANETS AND COMETS ROUND THE SUN.</p>

<p>§ 14. You have learned, in the preceding lesson, that the Earth and the
other Planets are regularly moving round the Sun; but you must know that the
time which each requires to complete a whole revolution, that is, the time which
each needs to move once round, cannot be the same with all; as you may easily
judge yourself: for the Planets which are next to the Sun will, of course,
have a much smaller journey to perform, than those which are further from it.
Thus Mercury, which is the first Planet in order from the Sun, will naturally
come round much sooner than Jupiter, which is placed at a much greater distance
from it.</p>

<p>That you may the easier understand this, the following Plate, No. VI, will represent
to you our Solar System:</p>

<p>The Sun from which proceeds all light and heat, is placed in the centre.
Then come the Planets Mercury and Venus; Third in order is our Earth
with its Satellite the Moon; and so on. The rest of the Planets in the
same order in which they are represented on Plate <a href="#i_012">II</a>. You will also perceive
there the orbs of two Comets, distinguished as you were told, by a tail of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</span>light. The Planets Jupiter, Saturn and Herschel are each represented with their
Moons, and the Planet Saturn with its luminous ring.</p>
<br>

<em>N<sup>o</sup>. VI.</em><br>

</figcaption>
</figure>
<br>

<p>Now you will easily understand that Ceres, Vesta, Juno, Pallas, Mars,
Jupiter, Saturn and Herschel, have each a much greater distance to travel, than
our Earth; but that, on the contrary, Venus and Mercury can complete their
revolution in a much shorter time.<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>§ 15. The time which our Earth needs to travel once completely round the
Sun, (to finish one revolution) is called a <em>Year</em>. Such a year has three hundred
and Sixtyfive days;—and each of these days has again Twentyfour hours.</p>

<p>You see from this that the revolution of the Earth round the Sun gives us <em>a
means of measuring time</em>, by which we are able to bring order and regularity into
our business and transactions of life. For the making of clocks and watches is
but a late invention, and we should be left entirely in the dark as regards the
history of former ages, and a great many people would, at this present moment,
be incapable of forming a correct estimate of time, if Providence had not given
to all this appropriate means of measuring it.</p>

<p>§ 16. While the Earth needs a whole year for one revolution round the Sun;
Mercury requires but Eightyone days, and Venus only about two thirds of
One of our years. Mars, on the contrary, needs for one of his revolutions almost
Two years; Vesta almost Four; Juno, Ceres and Pallas over Four years;
Jupiter almost Twelve, Saturn over Twentynine, and Herschel nearly Eightyfour
of our years!<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>—And if these Planets, as we have reason to believe, are
inhabited by beings endowed with human understanding and faculties, numbering
their years as we do ours—by the revolution of their Planets round the
Sun—how different from ours must be the Period of their existence!!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span></p>

<p>§ 17. During the time that the Earth is performing her journey round the Sun,
the Moon, our constant attendant, is continually moving round the Earth, <em>and
completes one of these revolutions in little more than Twentyseven days</em>.—Very
important and interesting to us are the changes in appearance which she exhibits
during each of these revolutions.—You probably will know, that the Moon does
not appear to us, at all times, the same. Sometimes she is hardly at all visible,
(at least not with the naked eye); at other times only a small rim of her is
seen, which by degrees becomes larger and larger, until finally she appears in
her full round form. After this she begins again to diminish, changes again
into a small luminous rim, and finally disappears entirely from our sight. These
successive changes in the Moon’s appearance are called <em>the Moon’s Phases</em>, or
the <em>waxing and waning of the Moon</em>. The time during which the Moon is not
seen is called <em>New Moon</em>; the time during which she exhibits her full shape is
called the <em>Full Moon</em>; and the different periods of her waxing and waning
(when she appears to us in the form of a crescent) are called <em>Quarters</em>. Thus we
speak of the <em>First</em> and of the <em>Last</em> Quarter of the Moon. The First Quarter
takes place after New Moon; the last Quarter after Full Moon.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The following diagram, Plate No. <a href="#i_028">VII</a>, may serve to represent to you the Moon’s phases as
seen from our Earth.</p>

<p>When the Moon is in <em>a</em>, then the light of the Sun falls just on that side of it which is turned
from the Earth. It is then, we have New Moon. When in <em>b</em>, a small brim of the Moon is seen,
because a small portion of its lighted surface is then turned towards the Earth.—When in <em>c</em> half
of her lighted surface is turned towards us, and we have the First Quarter. In <em>d</em> a still greater
portion of the Moon’s lighted surface is visible, and in <em>e</em>, we have Full Moon, because her
whole lighted surface is then turned towards the Earth. In <em>f</em> the moon commences to wane
(to grow smaller,) and in <em>g</em> the last quarter commences; finally, when passed through the point
<em>h</em>, we have in <em>a</em>, again New Moon. For familiar illustration you may also take a white ivory
ball, holding it before a lighted candle, which may take the place of the Sun. When the
ball is in a straight line between your eye and the candle it will appear to you all dark;
because the lighted part is then entirely turned toward the candle (away from you), and
you have the same case which is represented to you in the diagram, when the Moon is in <em>a</em>.
But if you move the ball a little to the right, you will perceive a streak of light, similar to the
First Quarter represented in the Diagram, when the Moon is in <em>c</em>. If moved still farther to the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span>right, so that the whole lighted part of the ball is seen, it will resemble the Full Moon; represented
in the Diagram, when the Moon is in <em>e</em>.</p>

<p>§ 18. While the Moon is moving round the Earth, it often occurs that she is
placed in a direct line between ourselves and the Sun. In this case a greater or
less part of the Sun is concealed from us, which causes a diminution of light or
a partial darkness on our Earth. This we call an <em>Eclipse of the Sun</em>. (Such
an Eclipse took place in 1831, and you will probably have an opportunity of
seeing many more). If, on the contrary, the Earth is placed in a direct line
between the Sun and the Moon, then the Moon will be obscured by our Earth.
This is called an <em>Eclipse of the Moon</em>. The following two figures on Plate
No. VIII will serve for an illustration.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>You will easily perceive from them that if the Moon (as represented in Figure I) is placed in
a direct line between the Sun and ourselves, it must necessarily conceal from us part of that
luminary; and in this state cast a <em>shade</em> upon our Earth.</p>

<p>But if the <em>Earth</em> is placed in a direct line between the Sun and the Moon, (as represented in
Figure II), then the Moon will be much more obscured, because the Earth is much larger than
the Moon, and will therefore cast a much greater shade upon her.</p>
</div>

<p>§ 19. It remains for us to speak of that class of bodies known by the name
of <em>Comets</em>, (see Lesson I, § 6). Of these an unknown number belongs to our
Solar System.—(Some philosophers have estimated their number to be about
Twentyone; others think it must amount to several hundred). They move
round the Sun in exceedingly long ovals, having their transparent tails always
turned away from that luminary. What is most remarkable about them is the
astonishing degree of heat to which they are exposed on account of passing so
near the Sun, and the astonishing velocity with which they travel.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The Comet which appeared in the year 1680, is supposed to sustain a heat nearly Two
Thousand times greater than that of red hot iron, and to move at the rate of several Hundred
Thousand miles an hour!!</p>

<p class="center no-indent fs90">ROTATION OF THE SUN, THE EARTH, AND THE REST OF THE PLANETS ON THEIR AXES.—DAY
AND NIGHT.—INCLINATION OF THE EARTH’S AXIS.—SEASONS.</p>

<p>§ 20. Besides the progressive motion of the Planets, of which we have spoken
in the last Lesson, they have yet a peculiar motion like a wheel turning on its
Axle-tree. This motion is called the <em>rotation of the Planets on their Axes</em>; because
each of them seems to move round a straight line passing through its
centre; like a ball turning round a piece of wire run through the middle of it.—Moreover
it is customary to call such a straight line imagined to be drawn
through the centre of a Planet—<em>the Axis of that Planet</em>.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The double motion of the Planets,—progressive and rotary,—is perhaps one of the most
difficult things for young pupils properly to understand, without some popular illustration. If the
teacher, therefore, has no orrery to show this motion to his pupils, he may compare it to a screw
which is turned round whilst it suffers at the same time a progressive motion; or perhaps with
more propriety to a spinning-top, which is continually turning on its Axis, while at the same
time it describes large circles.<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span></p>

<p>§ 21. If you have well understood what has just been said, you will be
able to comprehend, that <em>our Earth, while it is performing its great journey
round the Sun in Three Hundred and Sixtyfive days, is, at the same time,
every Twentyfour hours turning on its Axis</em>. This <em>rotary</em> motion of our Earth
on its Axis is the cause of the successive changes of day and night; that portion
of the Earth which is turned toward the Sun having always day, when the other,
which is turned away from him, has night.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>This is again a wise dispensation of God’s providence. For if the Earth would always keep
the same relative position to the Sun, then that portion of it, which would then be turned toward
the Sun, would have continual day, whilst the other, which would then be turned away from
him, would be enveloped in perpetual darkness. But as it is now arranged by the Earth’s rotation
on its Axis, most every portion of its surface must at least <em>once</em> every Twentyfour hours
be turned toward the Sun and receive from him light and heat. Without this, one great half of
our Earth would have a perpetual winter, destructive to plants and animals, while an everlasting
summer would scorch the other half and render it equally unfit for the support of man.</p>
</div>

<p>The following Diagram, Plate <a href="#i_036">IX</a>, may serve to give you an idea of the Earth’s
rotation round its Axis, and the alternate succession of Day and Night, resulting
from it. When the Earth is situated as represented in the Diagram, then that portion
of it, which is marked A, will have Day, because it is turned toward the Sun;
and the portion marked B, will have Night. But in the course of the next Twelve
hours the order will be reversed. The portion which is marked B, will be
turned toward the Sun and have day, whilst the portion A will be turned from
him, and have night.</p>

<p>§ 22. The rotation of the Earth on its Axis is also the cause of the <em>Rising</em>
and <em>Setting of the Sun</em>. For no portion of our Earth is at once turned toward or
from the Sun; but moves toward or from it by degrees (as you may see by slowly
turning a ball near the flame of a candle). This gradual motion of each portion
of the Earth’s surface toward or from the Sun, makes the Sun himself appear
to us as rising and going down; while, in fact, we ourselves are turning
towards, or receding from him. This is a kind of deception similar to
that which you experience when slowly gliding down a river; when the objects
on shore have the appearance of receding from you, while in fact, it is you,
yourself, who are travelling away from them.</p>
<br>

<p class="right">
<em>N<sup>o</sup>. IX.</em><br>
</p>
</figcaption>
</figure>
<br>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The gradual rise and setting of the Sun is another excellent provision of nature. Were we
from the darkness of night at <em>once</em> exposed to the luminous rays of the Sun, it would dazzle our
eyes and render them unfit to distinguish a single object.—It is only by a gradual transition
from darkness to light that we are able to accustom our eyes to the brilliancy of noon.</p>
</div>

<p>§ 23. There is another peculiarity in the situation of our Earth with regard to
the Sun, which you have not yet learned. The Earth’s Axis is not even
(parallel) with that of the Sun; but is somewhat inclined towards it, as represented
in the last Diagram. To this is owing the <em>Change of the Seasons</em>.
For on account of the inclination of the Earth’s Axis, the Sun’s rays fall, sometimes
nearly perpendicular upon us, while at other times they are striking us
more obliquely<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>. This is the principal cause of those changes of temperature
which we are in the habit of distinguishing by the names, <em>Spring</em>, <em>Summer</em>, <em>Autumn</em>
and <em>Winter</em>.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>In winter the Sun’s rays strike us most obliquely; it is therefore the coldest season of the
year. In summer they are most perpendicular;—Summer therefore is the hottest season.
Spring and autumn are standing in the middle between these two. From spring till mid-summer
the Sun’s rays are striking us more and more perpendicularly; from mid-summer till winter more
and more obliquely.</p>
</div>

<p>A similar change of temperature is felt every day from Sun-rise (when the Sun-beams
are most oblique) till noon, (when they are most perpendicular); and from
noon again towards evening or Sun-set, when they are again oblique.</p>

<p>§ 24. It has been mentioned (Lesson IV, § 20), that each Planet in our Solar
System is regularly turning on its Axis. But all of them do not perform this
rotation with equal <em>velocity</em>. The Planets which are farther from the Sun are
turning quicker than those which are near him. Jupiter, for instance, turns on
its Axis twice as fast as our Earth. The nights in Jupiter, therefore, do not last
half as long as ours.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span></p><div class="blockquot">

<p>This is, in some degree, necessary. For in proportion as a planet is further from the Sun, it
receives less light and heat, which deficiency is, in part, made up by a more frequent exposition
to his rays.</p>
</div>

<p>§ 25. The <em>Sun</em> himself is also known to turn regularly on his Axis, and to
complete one whole rotation in about Twentysix of our days. This we have
been able to perceive from the spots which have been discovered on its surface,
and which gradually move toward and disappear on one side, when in a short
time after they appear again on the other.</p>

<p>§ 26. The Moon, and the Satellites of the other Planets have no rotary
motion; but have always the same side turned towards their Planets. Thus the
moon keeps constantly the same side turned towards the Earth; but her monthly
motion round the Earth (Lesson III, § 17) is equal to a rotation on her axis; because
by this means every part of her is, at least, once every Twentyseven days
turned toward the Sun; as you may see from the Moon’s phases, represented on
plate <a href="#i_028">VII</a>. A day in the Moon, therefore, is equal to Twentyseven of our days;
because the Moon moves in Twentyseven of our days round the Earth, which
is equal to turning once on her axis.</p>

<p class="center no-indent fs90">OF THE APPEARANCE AND PECULIARITIES OF THE MOON AND SOME OF THE PLANETS WHEN
VIEWED THROUGH A TELESCOPE.</p>

<p>§ 27. Next to the Sun there is no heavenly body so interesting to us as the
<em>Moon</em>. When viewed through a good Telescope<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> she has nearly the same
appearance as in Figure I, Plate <a href="#i_043">X</a>. The bright parts are supposed to be
lofty mountains and tracts of land; (which is evident also from the shadow
which they cast) and the dark spots are supposed to be valleys and caverns.
Many of the mountains of the Moon are higher than the largest mountains
on the Earth. Some of them are volcanos, and their eruptions have been distinctly
observed by many distinguished Philosophers. Some of the caverns are
ascertained to have a depth of many miles and a width of almost Three miles.—No
water has as yet been discovered in the Moon. Hence if she is inhabited,
as we have reason to believe, her inhabitants must be very differently constructed
from ourselves.</p>

<p>§ 28. Among the Planets <em>Venus</em> is by far the most beautiful in appearance.
She is known also by the name of the <em>Morning</em> and <em>Evening Star</em>. Her light is
so bright that she is often seen at <em>Noon</em>. When viewed through a good telescope
she exhibits phases similar to those of the Moon (Lesson III, § 17), which
proves her spherical form (Lesson I, § 3). The mountains in Venus have been

is only half as dense as ours.</p>

<p>§ 29. Mars appears in many respects similar to our Earth. His light is red
and changeable; his surface exhibits black changeable spots (see Figure II,
Plate <a href="#i_043">X</a>). Some philosophers pretend to have noticed a region of ice on his
poles. His atmosphere is twice as dense as ours.</p>

<p>§ 31. Very remarkable, as we have already observed, is the Planet Saturn,
on account of its luminous ring. Viewed through a telescope it has the appearance,
represented in Figure IV. It is highly probable that to the inhabitants of
that Planet, this ring has an entirely different appearance from what it has to us.
It appears to be a solid opaque mass, and is probably inhabited like the Planet,
which it constantly accompanies on its journey round the Sun. Saturn’s atmosphere
is nearly Ninety times denser than that of our Earth. No mountains have
as yet been discovered on its surface.</p>

<p class="center no-indent fs90">DESCRIPTION OF THE EARTH’S SURFACE.—DIVISION OF IT INTO ZONES.—TORRID, TEMPERATE
AND ARCTIC ZONES.—THE FIVE GREAT CONTINENTS.—RELATIVE DIMENSIONS OF
AMERICA, EUROPE, ASIA, AFRICA AND AUSTRALIA.</p>

<p>§ 32. Having learned the relation of our Earth to the Sun and the Planets,
it will be well to acquaint ourselves with the principal objects on its surfaces.—What
the <em>Interior</em> of our Earth consists of, we have as yet no idea, because
we have not yet been able to penetrate deeper than a few hundred feet; and this
is, in proportion to the Earth’s Diameter, little more than nothing. But as
regards her surface, we know that it consists partly of land and partly of water.
Little more than one fourth of the Earth’s surface is covered with land; all the
rest is water.—The great lands are called <em>Continents</em>; the great waters are
called <em>Oceans</em>. Smaller portions of land surrounded on all sides by water, are
called <em>Islands</em>. Smaller bodies of water surrounded by land are called <em>Lakes</em>.</p>

<p>§ 33. The land on our Earth is divided into Five Continents: America, Europe,
Asia, Africa and Australia.—These, however, are not all of the same
extent. Europe is the smallest of them. America and Asia are the greatest.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The adjoining Plate No. <a href="#i_047">XI</a>, will give you an idea of the proportion of land and water on our
Earth, and of the relative extent of the Five Continents.</p>

<p>Fig. I represents the surface of the Earth divided into land and water. Were all land on our
Earth put together in a circle, and the water placed round it, then the land would only fill the
inner circle, the water occupying the surrounding ring, a space nearly four times as large as
the circle. Fig. II, III, IV, V and VI represent the comparative surfaces of America, Europe,
Asia, Africa and Australia. Fig. VII represents the comparative surface of the Moon.</p>
</div>

<p>Upon close inspection of these figures you will perceive;</p>

<p>1. That the extent of America and Asia are nearly equal; but that each of
these Continents is several times larger than either Europe or Australia.</p>

<p>2. That the next greatest portion of our Globe is <em>Africa</em>, which is more than
three times larger than Europe.</p>

<p>3. That Europe is the smallest Continent of our globe.</p>

<p>4. That the whole surface of the Moon would not be more than enough to
cover either America or Asia.</p>

<p>§ 34. The Earth’s surface is not throughout equally illumined or heated by the
Sun; because the Sun’s rays strike some portions of the Earth more perpendicular
than others. Our Earth, therefore, is divided into <em>Climates</em> or <em>Zones</em>, which
you will understand better from Plate <a href="#i_049">XII</a>.</p>

<p>You will see from it that the Sun’s rays are perpendicular to the central part of
the Earth’s surface; but that toward the extremities of the Earth’s Diameter
these rays strike us more and more <em>obliquely</em>. The greatest heat, therefore,
must be felt by the people living between the two circles EF and IK. The circle
GH, which is exposed to the perpendicular rays, is termed the <em>Equator</em>; and the
two circles EF and IK, <em>which are at equal distance from the Equator, are called
Tropic Circles</em>. The whole surface included by these two circles is called the
<em>torrid Zone</em>. The space between either of the circles CD and EF, or IK and
LM, is called a <em>temperate Zone</em>; because the Sun’s rays striking these portions
neither perpendicular nor very obliquely, their inhabitants suffer neither great
heat nor cold. In one of these Zones are situated the United States of America
and the greater portion of Europe. Beyond them, toward the extremities of the
Diameter AB, are the two <em>icy</em> or <em>arctic</em> zones. The Sun’s rays strike them
very obliquely; which is the cause of their being almost continually covered with
ice or snow.</p>

<p>The two circles, CD and LM, are called <em>Polar</em> circles; and the two extremities,
A and B, of the Earth’s Diameter, situated in those regions, are called <em>the
Poles</em>. A is called the <em>North-Pole</em> and B the <em>South-Pole</em> of the Earth.</p>

<p>§ 35. The different zones of which we have just spoken, are not equal to one
another. Plate <a href="#i_050">XIII</a>, will show their relative extent.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Fig. I represents the surface of the Earth divided proportionally into its three zones: the
<em>torrid</em>, the <em>temperate</em> and the <em>arctic</em>. The inner circle represents both the arctic zones; the
yellow ring b, which surrounds it, represents the united extent of the two temperate zones; and
the outmost red ring, the whole of the two <em>torrid zones</em>.</p>

<p>Fig. II represents separately the whole torrid zone;—Fig. III one of the temperate zones;—Fig.
IV one of the arctic zones; and Fig. V the whole extent of land on our globe.</p>

<p>The next Plate, No. XIV, represents the comparative surfaces of these zones, drawn separately
in form of squares; and the last figure on that Plate, shows the extent of the five continents,
compared to one of the temperate zones.</p>

<p>You will observe from a close inspection of these figures, that the whole extent
of land on our globe is nearly equal to that of a temperate zone; and that if it
were possible to unite America, Europe, Asia, Africa and Australia into one, their
united extent would not yet fill one of the temperate zones! You will also perceive
that the two temperate zones occupy together the greatest portion of the Earth’s
surface, and that the arctic zones occupy comparatively the smallest.</p>

<p>[§ 32.] Do we know anything about the Interior of our Earth? Why not?
What does the surface of our Earth consist of? What proportion does the land
bear to the water? What are the great lands called? What, the great waters?
What are smaller portions of land, surrounded by water, called? What, small
portions of water, surrounded by land?</p>

<p>[§ 33.] Into how many continents is all the land of our Globe divided? What
are they? Are all the continents of our globe of the same extent? Which is
the smallest of them? Which are the largest? Explain Plate, No. XI.</p>

<p>What proportion does the extent of America bear to that of Asia? What
relation do these continents bear to Europe or Australia? What is the next
greatest portion on our globe? Which continent is the smallest? What relation
does the surface of the Moon bear to America or Asia?</p>

<p>[§ 34.] Is the whole Earth equally illumined or heated by the Sun? Why not?
What is, therefore, the surface of our Earth divided into? Upon what portion
of our Earth do the Sun’s rays fall perpendicular? What portion do they
strike more obliquely? What people, therefore, will experience the greatest heat?</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>[The pupil ought now to explain Plate <a href="#i_049">XII</a>. The elder pupils ought to draw a sphere with
the Equator, the tropic and arctic circles. They ought also to draw the Diameter of the Earth,
and indicate the North and South Pole.]</p>
</div>

<p>[§ 35.] If you compare the whole extent of land on our globe to the Contents
of one of the temperate zones, what proportion do you find them to bear to
each other? If it were possible to unite the five great continents, America,
Europe, Asia, Africa and Australia, what zone would they nearly fill? What two
zones occupy the largest portion of the Earth’s surface? What two, the smallest?</p>

<p class="center no-indent fs90">CONTAINING THE COMPARATIVE POPULATION OF THE DIFFERENT QUARTERS OF OUR GLOBE.</p>

<p class="center no-indent fs90">[The numbers are given in Table III.]</p>
<br>

<p>§ 36. The Five principal parts of our globe, America, Europe, Asia, Africa and Australia
are not equally thickly settled. Europe and Asia have, in proportion to their extent, the greatest
population; America and Australia the least.—The following Plate, No. XV, shows the comparative
population of these continents.</p>

<p>Fig. I represents the whole surface of land on our globe, inhabited by nearly One Thousand
Millions (One Billion) human beings. If these were to live throughout as close together as in
<em>Europe</em>, then they would only occupy a surface of land as large in proportion, as the inner circle
marked <em>a</em>. But the two rings, <em>b</em> and <em>c</em>, occupy each as much surface as the circle <em>a</em>; hence there
is yet room for twice as many human beings; before each quarter of the world is as thickly settled
as Europe.</p>

<p>Fig. II represents <em>Asia</em> and its population. If this quarter were settled as thickly as Europe
is, then its inhabitants would only fill the inner circle marked <em>b</em>; the ring <em>a</em>, therefore, is still left
for settlement.</p>

<p>Fig. III exhibits the population of Africa. If the inhabitants of this continent lived as close
together as those of Europe, they would only fill the inner circle, marked <em>c</em>, and the surrounding
ring might yet be inhabited.</p>

<p>Fig. IV shows the comparative population of America. Its inhabitants, crowded together as
the inhabitants of Europe, would only occupy the small circle <em>e</em>; the whole broad ring <em>f</em>, therefore,
is still left for settlement!!</p>

<p>Fig. V represents Australia. Its inhabitants, settled as in Europe, would only fill the circle <em>a</em>.</p>

<p>Fig. VI represents the population of Europe filling the whole of that Quarter.</p>

<p>The whole of these Six figures may represent to the pupil the comparative extents of the five
great continents of our globe; but the <em>inner circles</em> of these figures, and the whole of the sixth
figure, show their comparative populations. From a close inspection of this plate the pupil
may learn:</p>

<p>1. That the population of Asia is yet greater than that of all the rest of the world. (The
circle <em>b</em> in figure II being yet larger than the inner circles of all the other figures, and figure VI
taken together.)</p>

<p>2. That the population of Europe is as yet larger than that of America, Africa and Australia,
taken together.</p>

<p>3. That the population of Africa is larger than the joint populations of America and Australia.</p>

<p>4. That America if once settled as Europe is, will have more than Six times her population.</p>
